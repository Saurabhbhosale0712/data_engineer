Nice — I’ll walk you through a concrete, end-to-step example so you can see exactly how the hybrid pipeline behaves on real-looking notes.

I’ll use **3 sample recommendation notes (id-wise)**, show:

1. cleaning,
2. the LLM prompt we send,
3. two possible LLM responses (one well-formed JSON, one malformed),
4. how we parse / fallback with regex,
5. the mapped final table you would save.

I’ll include runnable Python snippets you can paste into Databricks (they simulate the LLM response so you don’t need a real call to see the flow).

# Sample data (3 rows)

```python
samples = [
  {"id":"L1001", "note": "Applicant: Amit Sharma. CIBIL 725. Loan ₹12,50,000 for Home renovation. EMI: 18,500. No DPD."},
  {"id":"L1002", "note": "Customer: Ritu Verma | cibil score - 640 | loan amount INR 7,50,000 (for business expansion). 30 dpd recorded once."},
  {"id":"L1003", "note": "Borrower unknown. Notes: repayment ok, expected loan 2 lakh, credit profile good."}
]
```

---

## Step 1 — Lightweight cleaning

Keep currency symbols and numbers, remove weird characters.

```python
import re
def clean_note(t):
    if not t: return ""
    t = re.sub(r'\s+',' ', t).strip()
    t = re.sub(r"[^\w\s,₹₹\/().:-]", "", t)   # keep ₹, ., :, -, (, ), / and commas
    return t

for r in samples:
    r["cleaned"] = clean_note(r["note"])
samples
```

**Resulting cleaned notes:**

* L1001 cleaned: `"Applicant: Amit Sharma. CIBIL 725. Loan ₹12,50,000 for Home renovation. EMI: 18,500. No DPD."`
* L1002 cleaned: `"Customer: Ritu Verma | cibil score - 640 | loan amount INR 7,50,000 (for business expansion). 30 dpd recorded once."`
* L1003 cleaned: `"Borrower unknown. Notes: repayment ok, expected loan 2 lakh, credit profile good."`

## Step 2 — Build the strict prompt (we ask for JSON list)

```python
prompt_header = """
You are an extraction assistant. For each input note return a JSON object with fields:
id, applicant_name, cibil_score, loan_amount, loan_purpose, dpd, emi, raw_insight.
Return a single JSON array only (no explanation).
Example: [{"id":"L1","applicant_name":"John Doe","cibil_score":720,...}, ...]
Now extract for the following notes in the same order:
"""
for r in samples:
    prompt_header += f'\nID: "{r["id"]}"\nNote: """{r["cleaned"]}"""\n'
print(prompt_header)
```

(That prompt is what you would send to the model.)

---

## Step 3 — Two example LLM responses (simulated)

### Case A — **Well-formed** JSON (ideal)

This is what we want the LLM to return:

```json
[
  {"id":"L1001","applicant_name":"Amit Sharma","cibil_score":725,"loan_amount":1250000,"loan_purpose":"Home renovation","dpd":null,"emi":18500,"raw_insight":"Good CIBIL, moderate loan for home reno."},
  {"id":"L1002","applicant_name":"Ritu Verma","cibil_score":640,"loan_amount":750000,"loan_purpose":"Business expansion","dpd":"30","emi":null,"raw_insight":"One 30-DPD occurrence; mid credit score."},
  {"id":"L1003","applicant_name":"","cibil_score":null,"loan_amount":200000,"loan_purpose":"unknown","dpd":null,"emi":null,"raw_insight":"Loan mentioned approx 2 lakh; borrower not named."}
]
```

**Parsing:** `json.loads(...)` succeeds. We map objects to rows by `id` and convert numeric fields.

---

### Case B — **Malformed / extra text** (real-world failure)

Model returns extra commentary or forgets to return JSON cleanly:

```
Here are the extracted items:

1) L1001 -> applicant: Amit Sharma; cibil 725; loan ₹12,50,000; EMI 18,500.

2) L1002 -> Ritu Verma; cibil 640; loan 7,50,000; dpd 30 days once.

3) L1003 -> Name not found; loan about 2 lakh.

(If you need JSON tell me)
```

`json.loads` fails. In that case the pipeline **tries to find a JSON substring** but finds none — so we apply regex fallback per note.

---

## Step 4 — Regex fallback logic (how it extracts)

Example fallback extractor (simplified):

```python
import re
def fallback(note):
    out = {}
    m_cibil = re.search(r"\b([3-9][0-9]{2})\b", note)
    out["cibil_score"] = int(m_cibil.group(1)) if m_cibil else None

    m_amt = re.search(r"(?:₹|INR|Rs\.?)\s*([0-9,]+(?:\s*(?:lakh|lac|crore|cr))?)", note, re.I)
    if m_amt:
        # naive convert: handle comma-numbers and "lakh" convert
        s = m_amt.group(1).replace(",", "").lower()
        if "lakh" in s or "lac" in s:
            num = float(re.sub(r"[^\d\.]","",s)) * 100000
        else:
            num = float(re.sub(r"[^\d\.]","",s))
        out["loan_amount"] = int(num)
    else:
        # also check "2 lakh" style
        m = re.search(r"(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)\s*lakh", note, re.I)
        out["loan_amount"] = int(float(m.group(1))*100000) if m else None

    m_name = re.search(r"(?:Applicant|Customer|Borrower)[:\s|]*([A-Z][a-z]+(?:\s[A-Z][a-z]+)?)", note)
    out["applicant_name"] = m_name.group(1) if m_name else ""

    m_emi = re.search(r"EMI[:\s]*([0-9,]+)", note, re.I)
    out["emi"] = int(m_emi.group(1).replace(",","")) if m_emi else None

    m_dpd = re.search(r"(\d{1,3})\s*(?:dpd|days past due|dpd recorded)", note, re.I)
    out["dpd"] = m_dpd.group(1) if m_dpd else None

    return out
```

Applied to our three cleaned notes:

* L1001 fallback => `applicant_name: "Amit Sharma", cibil_score: 725, loan_amount: 1250000, emi: 18500, dpd: None`
* L1002 fallback => `applicant_name: "Ritu Verma", cibil_score: 640, loan_amount: 750000, dpd: "30", emi: None`
* L1003 fallback => `applicant_name: "", cibil_score: None, loan_amount: 200000 (from "2 lakh"), emi: None`

---

## Step 5 — Put results together (LLM if valid, else fallback)

Pseudo logic:

```python
final_rows = []
if parsed_json_is_valid:
    use parsed_json values (with safe casts)  # extraction_source = "llm"
else:
    for each note:
        fb = fallback(note["cleaned"])
        final_rows.append({ "id": note["id"], **fb, "raw_insight": "", "extraction_source": "fallback"})
```

### Example final table (Case A — ideal)

| loan_application_id | applicant_name | cibil_score | loan_amount | loan_purpose       | dpd  | emi   | raw_insight                                       | extraction_source |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------------ | ---- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| L1001               | Amit Sharma    | 725         | 1250000     | Home renovation    | null | 18500 | Good CIBIL, moderate loan for home reno.          | llm               |
| L1002               | Ritu Verma     | 640         | 750000      | Business expansion | "30" | null  | One 30-DPD occurrence; mid credit score.          | llm               |
| L1003               |                | null        | 200000      | unknown            | null | null  | Loan mentioned approx 2 lakh; borrower not named. | llm               |

### Example final table (Case B — model returned garbage, we used fallback)

| loan_application_id | applicant_name | cibil_score | loan_amount | loan_purpose | dpd  | emi   | raw_insight | extraction_source |
| ------------------- | -------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------------ | ---- | ----- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| L1001               | Amit Sharma    | 725         | 1250000     |              | null | 18500 |             | fallback          |
| L1002               | Ritu Verma     | 640         | 750000      |              | "30" | null  |             | fallback          |
| L1003               |                | null        | 200000      |              | null | null  |             | fallback          |

## Why this is robust for production

* LLM-first: extracts semantic fields like `loan_purpose` and readable `raw_insight`.
* Regex fallback: guaranteed deterministic extraction for numbers and patterns; ensures you never lose all structure when LLM misbehaves.
* Mapping by `id`: prevents misalignment between inputs & outputs.
* Merge/append to Delta: incremental and safe for production.

## Ready-to-run minimal demo (simulate both cases)

Paste into a Databricks Python cell — this simulates the two flows.

```python
import json

# use the samples and clean function from above
# simulate MODEL RESPONSE A (good) or B (bad)
MODEL_GOOD = json.dumps([
  {"id":"L1001","applicant_name":"Amit Sharma","cibil_score":725,"loan_amount":1250000,"loan_purpose":"Home renovation","dpd":None,"emi":18500,"raw_insight":"Good CIBIL"},
  {"id":"L1002","applicant_name":"Ritu Verma","cibil_score":640,"loan_amount":750000,"loan_purpose":"Business expansion","dpd":"30","emi":None,"raw_insight":"One 30-DPD"},
  {"id":"L1003","applicant_name":"","cibil_score":None,"loan_amount":200000,"loan_purpose":"unknown","dpd":None,"emi":None,"raw_insight":"Approx 2 lakh noted"}
])

MODEL_BAD = """Here are results:
1) L1001 -> Amit Sharma; CIBIL 725; loan ₹12,50,000; EMI 18,500.
2) L1002 -> Ritu; cibil 640; loan 7,50,000; 30 dpd.
3) L1003 -> loan ~2 lakh; name missing.
"""

def try_parse_model(text):
    try:
        parsed = json.loads(text)
        return parsed
    except:
        return None

print("=== Good model parse ===")
print(try_parse_model(MODEL_GOOD))
print("=== Bad model parse ===")
print(try_parse_model(MODEL_BAD))   # returns None -> triggers fallback
```

---

## Next steps I can do for you (pick one)

* A: Produce a runnable `mapPartitions` version that avoids `.collect()` and handles very large tables.
* B: Add a `confidence` field (ask LLM to include confidence per field and implement thresholding).
* C: Provide a full Databricks notebook file (.dbc or .py) ready to import — with secret handling and job scheduling.

Which one do you want me to build next?
